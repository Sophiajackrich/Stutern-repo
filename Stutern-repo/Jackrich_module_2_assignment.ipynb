# Module 2 (Assignment)

### Qs 1. 
a. Write a function called `make_album()` that builds a dictionary describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the 
album information correctly.
    
b. Use `None` to add an optional parameter to `make_album()` that allows you to store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for
the number of songs, add that value to the album’s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.

    
c. Write an updated version of the function above called `make_album_updated()` that accepts the ***required*** arguments `artist_name`, `album_title`, `num_of_songs` and some ***arbitrary optional*** arguments like `year_released`, etc.
